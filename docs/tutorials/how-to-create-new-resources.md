# How to Create New Resources

Monokle is a fully integrated IDE for managing manifests. It provides instant access for debugging Kubernetes resources
without looking into the YAML syntax.

In this tutorial, we have illustrated steps to create new resources for including new features in your project.

Letâ€™s get started.

**Step 1:** Launch Monokle and click on the Browse button to add your project folder containing K8 resources.

<em>**Note:** Please follow this [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) guide to install Monokle ðŸš€</em>
